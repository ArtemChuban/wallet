## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.4 locks (pending execution):

- In-app MCP host (not sidecar / not app-spawned agent)
- MCP v1.4 = read-only + Streamable HTTP on `/api/mcp`
- Localhost Host/Origin + Compose `127.0.0.1` publish only

### Pending Todos

- Add timezone selection to settings (general, minor)
- Integrate local AI agent via subprocess (general, minor) — superseded by v1.4 MCP; revisit todo status after ship

### Blockers/Concerns

- mcp-handler export shape — verify at Phase 23 install (research flag; not blocking roadmap)
- Cursor CLI transport string — smoke in Phase 26; `mcp-remote` only on real fail
- Nyquist VALIDATION still draft on archived phases 19–22 (carry-forward tech debt)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 7: LOCF consolidation + Nyquist 3–6 (v1.0)
- Phase 8–12: debts refresh + Nyquist 10–11 (v1.1)
- Phases 13–17: v1.2 Доходы — SHIPPED 2026-09-08
- Phases 18–22: v1.3 Кредитка — SHIPPED 2026-09-10
- Phases 23–26: v1.4 Local MCP — roadmap created 2026-09-10
